# 🏦 ATM Simulator using Python and OOP

This is a **simple ATM simulator** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. It runs on the terminal and allows users to perform basic banking operations securely with PIN authentication.

> 🎯 Built as a hands-on exercise while learning OOP in Python — because real learning happens when you build!

## 💡 Features

✅ Menu-driven interface  
✅ 4-digit PIN setup & validation  
✅ Deposit money (with live balance update)  
✅ Withdraw money (with checks for insufficient funds & invalid inputs)  
✅ Check account balance  
✅ Secure access – PIN required before every transaction  
✅ Default account balance starts at ₹50,000

## 🔐 PIN Security

- Users must set a valid 4-digit PIN during initialization.
- All features require PIN verification.
- Program exits if the PIN format is incorrect.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- OOP principles: classes, methods, encapsulation  
- Terminal-based UI

---

## 🚀 Upcoming Upgrades

I’m currently working on adding:
- 🎨 A **GUI interface** using `Tkinter`  
- 📂 **File handling** to store balance & transaction data permanently  
- 🧪 Input validation & error logs for more robustness

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Practical implementation of **OOP concepts**  
- Real-world understanding of **user authentication & validation**  
- The importance of **clean logic** and **code readability**
